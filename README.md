This repository hosts source code for the following (related) projects :

*   [JNAerator](http://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/) parses C, C++ and Objective-C headers and generates Java bindings for use with BridJ, JNA or Rococoa
*   [BridJ](http://code.google.com/p/bridj/) is a runtime library that lets Java developers use C/C++ with dynamic bindings (no need to compile any native bindings)
*   [JavaCL](http://code.google.com/p/javacl/) provides OpenCL bindings + a high-level object-oriented API that hides away much of the complexity of GPGPU + useful utilities
*   [ScalaCL](http://code.google.com/p/scalacl/) provides GPGPU-powered collections for Scala, with map/filter operations running straight on the GPU (effectively converts Scala code to OpenCL)
*   [Scalaxy](http://code.google.com/p/scalaxy/) plugs into the Scala compiler to optimize Scala code (in particular, makes for loops much faster)
